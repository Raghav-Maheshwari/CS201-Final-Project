PLEASE READ DOCUMENTATION FILE FOR COMPLETE PROJECT DOCUMENTATION.

Description: This web application that acts as a “reverse career fair.” There will be 2 types of users, students and companies. Students can upload their school and personal projects to the website’s database and companies would see those projects. However, the students would remain anonymous to the companies, to remove any hiring bias. Students would automatically be authenticated users (using an official .edu email address), whereas companies would have to be authenticated to be able to reach out to students. Guest companies would be able to see projects but not ask for the student contact information.
